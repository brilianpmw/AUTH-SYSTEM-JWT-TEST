simple login auth using jwt

### Setup supporting service
*currently this service doesnt use any DB,Redis and anything but they are ready to use!


if you have add some DB/Cache/anything you might need to update docker-compose first!
Make sure you have docker service running.
On the root directory, run this command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
